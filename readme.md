# Barebones Ticket-Api
The idea of this project is to just recreate my nestJS ticket-api with nodejs, no dependencies but same functionalities.

## Functionalities should be:

1. Fully capable REST API which:  
    a. Creates, Reads, Updates and Deletes Tickets.  
    b. Creates, Reads, Updates and Deletes Users. 
2. Has a user Auth System with roles.
3. Has a logger which logs to console and files. Wont be as good as winston probably, but the idea is bare bones.
